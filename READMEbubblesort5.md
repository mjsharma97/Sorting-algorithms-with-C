In Bubblesort, we traverse i till n and compare element with it's next adjacent on the right, if it's smaller, we swap A[i], A][i+1].
In this process, the maximum element get's bubbled out at the end. Next we traverse i again, but till n-1, again compare and bubble out the second larfest at n-1.

time complexity O(n^2)
space complexity O(1)
 
Stable YES
